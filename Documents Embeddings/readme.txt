This is a general purpose sentence feature extraction algorithm called 
doc2vec("Document and sentence embeddings"-T.Mikolov and Li,2014).
I have also included a text preprocessing pipiline which includes tokenization, 
rare word removal, stopwords removal, html tags removal and detokenization, using
reges, nltk and some of my own solutions.
This pipeline could be used as a quick reference for preprocessing.
